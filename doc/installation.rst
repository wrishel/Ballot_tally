Installation
=====

This documentation is not available yet.

The system requires Python 3.9 and, at least, third-party packages OpenCV, Tesseract, pyzbar and Sphinx.

Portions of the project were developed on macOS, Windows-10 and Ubuntu. Hardware control of the scanner, a Fujitsu fi-5900c, is implemented using the SANE library on Ubuntu. All other portions of the system are probably easily ported among the OSs.
