# Ballot_tally

This is a work in progress for confirming vote counts generated by an official certified elections system. 

# Description

Volunteers obtain the paper ballots from the elections officials and produce scanned images. These images are processed by the software here to produce counts, which are then compared to the official results.

These comparisons may be used to identify specific races which were close and may require a recound.
