# READ-ME: ETBV - Election Transparency Ballot Verification

Version 0.1 (initial work in progress)

This repo contains the code for a collaborative project to be used to review and verify the ballots
of an election.

It is not intended to be official vote-counting software. The use of this software might 
identify specific contests or precincts that bear further investigation. 

This software was created to support the work of the Humboldt Election Transparency Project (HETP - https://electionstransparencyproject.com/),
an independent non-profit organization. 

##Status
This version has been used to review an election, however it is still in the primitive level
of development where it can only be run by its authors. 

## Intended Licensing
It is our intent to make this repository available in open source including for use in derived
products. At this point we have not determined which open source license works best.
If you have a suggestion in this regard, please contact us through GitHub.
